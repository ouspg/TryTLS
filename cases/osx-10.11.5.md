# OS X OpenSSL verification surprises

When using native python shipped in OS X, the systems default bundle will be
trusted even if instructed otherwise. This is troubling, as some organizations
do not want to trust the default bundles. Also lately, the reputation of some
CAs have been [brought into question](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11781915).

## How we found it

Issue was rediscovered with TryTLS. TryTLS is a tool which checks if programming
languages and libraries verify TLS certificates correctly. While developing the
tool, we found an unexpected behavior. Apple's patch to their OpenSSL, apparently
made [back in 2011] (https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2011/11/05/apples-modified-ca-cert-handling-and-curl/),  
gives the user of OpenSSL more CA's than she bargained for. If certificate check
fails with  user provided CA, Apple's OpenSSL *gives failed verifications a
second chance using the system keyring as trust store.*

## Not a new issue
This issue has been
[reported](https://hynek.me/articles/apple-openssl-verification-surprises/)
already 2014-03-03 by [Hynek Schlawack](https://hynek.me/).
[CVE-2014-2234](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-2234)
describes the vulnerability exists on *A certain Apple patch for OpenSSL in
Apple OS X 10.9.2*. However, we have reproduced it in OS X 10.11.5 (15F34)
2016-06-12. The same behavior was observed with other python libraries
(e.g. [urllib3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/urllib3), and
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)) - as long as the
python shipped with OS X was used.

# Suggested workarounds
 * User: avoid running python code with native OS X python installation
 * Developer: consider warning user if OS X native python is used
    and non-ca-bundle is set by the user.

# Tested Versions

### Code used for testing

The tests were run using a [stub](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/blob/43660507b45a59e01d7205df5ad98c704c8a555d/stubs/python-urllib2/run.py) developed for [TryTLS](https://github.com/ouspg/trytls/).
