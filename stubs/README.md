## Stubs

Example code (stubs) using TLS in different languages and libraries live in here.
You can contribute your stub here or just BYOR (Bring Your Own Repository).

These stubs should attempt to use the chosen language and library
properly to establish a secure TLS connection to the given destination.

"Have you heard of the TryTLS tester who lost his hands? He only had stubs left."

---

### Calling convention

All stubs should have a standalone program that takes up to three command
line arguments (`<host> <port> [ca-bundle]`):

 * `<host>` is the DNS name or IP-address of the service to connect to
 * `<port>` is the port to connect to
 * `[ca-bundle]` is optional location of the CA certificate bundle
   file to be used. The bundle file should consists of PEM encoded
   certificates concatenated together.

Depending on the TLS library used in stub, the library might use own
CA certificate bundle bundled with library or use one delivered by
operating system.


---

### Return values

Stubs should attempt to establish a **secure** connection to the given
service(host + port) and catch possible errors and exceptions to determine if the connection was successful.

The last string the stub should print is the verdict (UNSUPPORTED, ACCEPT etc.). If you want the stub to print additional context such as the reason to accept/reject connection or an error message, the stub should print them before the verdict.

The data outputted by the stub should follow the following set of instructions or a similar one.

<pre>
1.0 print (optional context)
2.0 if [the stub couldn't implement the requested behaviour (e.g. setting CA certificate bundle)] then
    print "UNSUPPORTED"
    return zero
3.0 else if [the stub could connect to the service] then
    print "ACCEPT"
    return zero
4.0 else if [the stub could not connect to the service] then
    print "REJECT"
    return zero
5.0 else ("fatal error occured")
    (optional error message)
    return value other than zero
</pre>
---

### Testing the stub

To test that the stub works as it should you can perform couple of
easy tests by running it on command line (stub is named `run.test`
in these examples).

Running the program without any arguments should give error message:

```sh
$ run.test
<This should print some kind of (helpful) error message>
```

Connecting to `google.com` on HTTPS port should be success:

```sh
$ run.test google.com 443
ACCEPT or UNSUPPORTED
```

Connecting to `badssl.com`'s `untrusted-root` should be failure:

```sh
$ run.test untrusted-root.badssl.com 443
REJECT or UNSUPPORTED
```

If these simple tests work, your stub is ready to be tested with
TryTLS runner.

If you want to test the CA bundle argument, then you need valid CA
bundle file for example from
[certifi.io](https://certifi.io/en/latest/).

Download the certifi.io CA bundle to file named `ca-bundle.pem` (with
for example curl: `curl -L -o ca-bundle.pem
https://mkcert.org/generate/`) and then test:

```sh
$ run.test google.com 443 ca-bundle.pem
ACCEPT
```

### Packaging

A stub should be confined to a directory named in a way that describes the
chosen target language and library or service, e.g. `<language>-<library>`.

A stub should have a top level `README.md` which describes how to run the stub and
how to install the potential dependancies needed.

The stubs should have a `run` command with optional and approriate file
extension for the language in question.

Optionally a stub can have a `Dockerfile` that encapsulates the environment
and the dependancies needed to run the example.

Ideally, one should also include a `results.md` that contains the result of a test run as follows:

```
platform: Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)
runner: trytls 0.1.0 (CPython 2.7.11+, OpenSSL 1.0.2g-fips)
stub: python 'stubs/python-urllib2/run.py'
 PASS expired certificate [reject expired.badssl.com:443]
 PASS wrong hostname in certificate [reject wrong.host.badssl.com:443]
 PASS self-signed certificate [reject self-signed.badssl.com:443]
 ...
```
