# TryTLS stub for PHP remote file Handling

Although this stub uses only `file_get_contents()` it is likely to test the
same remote file mechanism that at least `fopen()`, `include()`, `include_once()`,
`require()`, `require_once()` and the `imagecreatefromXXX()`-functions use when
called with remote file URLs.

# How to run

```console
./run.php expired.badssl.com 443
```

# Dependencies

  * PHP (version >= 4.3.0) [compiled with OpenSSL support](http://php.net/manual/en/openssl.installation.php).
   * Context support that allows controlling peer certificate verification
   and used CA-bundle was added with PHP 5.0.0.

# Building Dockerfile

docker build -t php-file-get-contents .
